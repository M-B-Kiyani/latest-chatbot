## Troubleshooting Voice Commands

### AI Didn't Understand?

Try rephrasing:

- Instead of: "Sometime next week"
- Say: "Next Monday at 2 PM"

### AI Asking for Info You Already Gave?

Repeat it clearly:

- "My email is john@example.com"
- Spell it if needed: "J-O-H-N at example dot com"

### Want to Change Something?

Be explicit:

- "Change the time to 3 PM"
- "Actually, make it tomorrow instead"
- "Can we do 30 minutes instead of 15?"
